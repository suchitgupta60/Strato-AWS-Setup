# Strato-AWS-Setup

AWS Marketplace offer - getting started with BlockApps STRATO on AWS

## BlockApps STRATO instance on AWS marketplace
- On the AWS marketplace search for the keyword "blockapps" or "blockchain" and you'll find our listed offer (with a 5-day free trial edition).

*This individual STRATO instance (private blockchain node, self-contained and sufficient for prototyping and light POC's) provides a RESTful web API on the HTTP port for querying the blockchain and compiling and uploading contracts.*

## Run on VM

**Steps to run STRATO Developer Edition using the AWS marketplace AMI:**

*All the setup is already done for you in the packaged AMI, just run the startup script to launch the platform services.*

- Step 1: Login to your AWS account or create one if you don't already have one.
- Step 2: Deploy a new EC2 instance from the BlockApps STRATO AMI, with at least 20 GB of space on the root volume.
- Step 3: SSH to your newly deployed node (user: ubuntu).
- Step 4: Run strato-admin script (takes about 10-20secs to see all docker containers running): 
```bash
$ ./strato-admin.sh --start
```

**Note: if the instance services do not come up within a minute, you can restart the services using:**
```bash
./strato-admin.sh --stop 

./strato-admin.sh --start
```

*The single instance will provide the following (all on port 80):

>username: *admin* 

>password: *ec2-instanceID*
